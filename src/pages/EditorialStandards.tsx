      <p>Vedi Napoli is committed to clear, fair, and responsible digital publishing.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-serif text-napoli-dark mt-8 mb-4">1. Editorial independence</h2>
      <p>Vedi Napoli operates as an independent publication. Editorial decisions are made independently and are not influenced by advertisers, sponsors, affiliate relationships, or third-party commercial interests.</p>
      <p>If content is sponsored, paid, promotional, or produced in partnership with a commercial entity, that relationship will be clearly disclosed.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-serif text-napoli-dark mt-8 mb-4">2. Sourcing</h2>
      <p>Vedi Napoli aims to rely on reputable and relevant sources, including official club statements, direct source material, public records, reputable media reporting, and clearly attributed commentary.</p>
      <p>When information is unconfirmed, disputed, rumor-based, or developing, this will be stated clearly in the article.</p>
      <p>Vedi Napoli does not knowingly present rumor as confirmed fact.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-serif text-napoli-dark mt-8 mb-4">3. Distinction between fact and opinion</h2>
      <p>News reporting, analysis, and opinion serve different editorial purposes and should be distinguishable.</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-2">
        <li>News should describe verifiable developments.</li>
        <li>Analysis should interpret events based on evidence and context.</li>
        <li>Opinion should reflect a clearly attributable point of view.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-serif text-napoli-dark mt-8 mb-4">4. Accuracy and updates</h2>
      <p>Accuracy matters more than speed. When an article includes time-sensitive facts, the publication may update the piece as new information becomes available.</p>
      <p>Material changes should be reflected transparently, especially where the original version could mislead readers.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-serif text-napoli-dark mt-8 mb-4">5. Corrections</h2>
      <p>If Vedi Napoli publishes incorrect factual information, it will correct the error clearly and as promptly as reasonably possible.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-serif text-napoli-dark mt-8 mb-4">6. Use of AI tools</h2>
      <p>Vedi Napoli may use AI-assisted tools for research support, summarization, formatting, language polishing, metadata generation, and workflow automation.</p>
      <p>AI tools do not replace editorial responsibility. Final accountability for published content remains with the publisher or editor overseeing publication.</p>
      <p>AI-generated content should be reviewed before publication, especially for factual claims, names, dates, quotations, and translations.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-serif text-napoli-dark mt-8 mb-4">7. Respect and fairness</h2>
      <p>Coverage should avoid unnecessary personal attacks, discriminatory language, or deceptive framing. Criticism of clubs, players, executives, media, or institutions may be strong, but it should remain grounded in facts or clearly signposted opinion.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-serif text-napoli-dark mt-8 mb-4">8. Intellectual property</h2>
      <p>Vedi Napoli aims to publish original writing and properly attributed references. Full-text copying of third-party copyrighted journalism, photography, or premium content is not permitted without permission.</p>
