      <p>If a reader, source, or subject believes that an article contains a factual error, they may contact the publication using the contact details listed on the site. Requests should include the article URL, the specific statement believed to be incorrect, and, where possible, supporting information.</p>
      
      <p>When a factual error is confirmed, Vedi Napoli will correct it as promptly as reasonably possible. Significant corrections may be acknowledged in the article itself. Minor typographical or formatting fixes may be made without a formal editor's note.</p>
